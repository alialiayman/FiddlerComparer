# FiddlerRestSharp
Convert fiddler request to RestSharp Code in C#
This Fiddler extension generates C# code to duplicate a web request as a RestSharp code.  

You simply drag one Fiddler sessions into the “RestSharp” tab to produce appropriate RestSharp code. 

To Install:

Copy FiddlerRequestToRestSharp.dll into your Fiddler2\Scripts folder.
You’ll need to restart Fiddler if it’s already running.

I used information from http://www.chadsowald.com/software/fiddler-extension-request-to-code

Feel free to download the code and extend it as you see fit.
