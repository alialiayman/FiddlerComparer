# FiddlerRestSharp
Convert fiddler request to RestSharp Code in C#
This Fiddler extension generates C# code to duplicate a web request as a RestSharp code.  You simply drag one Fiddler sessions into the “RestSharp” tab to produce appropriate code that you can copy and paste into your program that reproduces those requests. 

To Install:

Copy FiddlerRequestToRestSharp.dll into your Fiddler2\Scripts folder.
You’ll need to restart Fiddler if it’s already running.
